# `fedialgo`
Fedialgo is a `node.js` library offering a customizable algorithm for the federated social media platform [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/) that can free you from the tyranny of Mastodon's reverse chronological order timeline. It's based on [pkreissel's original implementation](https://github.com/pkreissel/fedialgo) and ideas though it has more or less been completely rewritten and has many more features like integration of trending toots, filtering of the feed by hashtag/user/etc., improved load times, and more.

# Installation
You can install this library from github with `npm`:

```bash
npm install --save github:michelcrypt4d4mus/fedialgo
```

Or with `yarn`:

```bash
yarn add https://github.com/michelcrypt4d4mus/fedialgo
```

### Troubleshooting
If you're using the library outside a browser and get a `Buffer is not a function` error you may also need the `buffer` package to simulate the one provided by most browsers. It's required by the `class-transformer` library FediAlgo uses to serialize data to browser storage.
```bash
npm install --save buffer
```

And then put this in your main entrypoint (e.g. `App.tsx` or something like that):

```typescript
import { Buffer } from 'buffer'; // Required for class-transformer to work
(window as any).Buffer = Buffer;
```

# Overview
The package implements a **multi-factor weighted scoring** pipeline to score each individual `Toot` and then sort your Mastodon timeline from the highest to lowest score so that you see the toots that are most interesting to you first. This is roughly the order of operations:

```
    Raw Posts
       ↓
Individual Scores
       ↓
 Weighted Scores
       ↓
   Time Decay
       ↓
Diversity Penalty
       ↓
Final Sorted Feed
```

**23 Scoring Factors** (all in [`src/scorer`](src/scorer/)):
- **Social Graph:** `AccountScorer`, `AuthorFollowersScorer`, `FollowedAccountsScorer`, `FollowersScorer`, `InteractionsScorer`, `RetootsInFeedScorer`
- **Engagement:** `NumFavouritesScorer`, `NumRepliesScorer`, `NumRetootsScorer`, `MentionsFollowedScorer`
- **Trending:** `TrendingTootsScorerScorer`, `TrendingTagsScorer`
- **User History:** `InteractionsScorer`, `FavouritedAccountsScorer`, `FavouritedTagsScorer`, `HashtagParticipationScorer`, `MostFavouritedAccountsScorer`, `MostRepliedAccountsScorer`, `ParticipatedTagsScorer`
- **User Preferences:** `FollowedTagsScorer`
- **Content Type:** `ImageAttachmentScorerScorer`, `VideoAttachmentScorer`
- **Diversity:** `DiversityFeedScorer` (penalizes topics and people that toot a lot)
- **Novelty:** `AlreadyShownScorer` (penalizes posts you've already been shown)
- **Randomness:** `ChaosScorer` (controlled randomness)

# Usage
The demo app's [`Feed` component](https://github.com/michelcrypt4d4mus/fedialgo_demo_app_foryoufeed/blob/master/src/pages/Feed.tsx) demonstrates the latest and greatest way to use Fedialgo but here's a quick overview of how to get up and running. This code assumes you already have an access token for a user and a registered Mastodon "application" on the Mastodon server allowing `read` scope access. If you don't have one see [the `masto.js` documentation](https://github.com/neet/masto.js/?tab=readme-ov-file#quick-start) for how to get one.

The FediAlgo demo app also contains a working example of how to execute the OAuth flow for a user to both register an app and get an authorized OAuth token for them:
* [Login page](https://github.com/michelcrypt4d4mus/fedialgo_demo_app_foryoufeed/blob/master/src/pages/LoginPage.tsx)
* [OAuth callback page](https://github.com/michelcrypt4d4mus/fedialgo_demo_app_foryoufeed/blob/master/src/pages/CallbackPage.tsx)


```typescript
import TheAlgorithm from "fedialgo"
import { createRestAPIClient, mastodon } from "masto";

const mastodonServer = "https://mastodon.social";
const accessToken = getTheUserAccessTokenSomehow();
const api = createRestAPIClient({accessToken: accessToken, url: mastodonServer});
const currentUser = await api.v1.accounts.verifyCredentials();  // NOTE: GoToSocial servers don't support verifyCredentials()

// Instantiate a TheAlgorithm object
const algo = await TheAlgorithm.create({
    api: api,
    user: currentUser,
    locale: "en-GB",     // optional (available in navigator.language in browser)
});
```

### The `setTimelineInApp` Callback
You are encouraged to pass an optional `setTimelineInApp()` callback to `TheAlgorithm.create()` to allow FediAlgo to directly manage the state of the timeline in your app. The callback will be invoked whenever the timeline is updated. More specifically it will be invoked when any of these things happen:

* A batch of toots is retrieved from the fediverse and integrated into the timeline
* You make a call to `updateUserWeights()` (see below)
* You make a call to `updateFilters()` (see below)
* A background data fetch incrementally loads more of the user's historical data (as the algorithm is responsive to the user's history of favourites, retoots, etc. additional data can reorder the feed slightly)

An example involving storing the timeline in a React component's state:

```typescript
import { useState } from React;
import TheAlgorithm, { Toot } from "fedialgo"

const [timeline, setTimeline] = useState<Toot[]>([]);

const algo = await TheAlgorithm.create({
    api: api,
    user: currentUser,
    setTimelineInApp: setTimeline
});
```

## Functionality
Once you've instantiated a `TheAlgorithm` object there's three primary ways of interacting with it:

#### Triggering Construction Of The Timeline
```typescript
import { Toot } from "fedialgo";

// Trigger the feed builder. FediAlgo will start doing stuff asynchronously. If you passed
// setTimelineInApp in the constructor all you need to do is monitor the state of whatever
// variable contains the timeline (in the React example above that would be 'timeline').
algo.triggerFeedUpdate();

// After first invocation check if loading is in progress before calling to avoid exceptions
if (!algo.isLoading) {
    algo.triggerFeedUpdate();
}

// algo.timeline returns the current weight-ordered/filtered array of Toot objects
// Note there won't be anything there until the timeilne is at least partially built!
let timeline: Toot[] = algo.timeline;
// If you wanted to wait until the feed was fully constructed, wait for the Promise:
algo.triggerFeedUpdate().then(() => timeline = algo.timeline);

// You can pull additional past timeline toots beyond the configured initial amount:
algo.triggerHomeTimelineBackFill();
```

#### Setting Weights For The Various Feed Scorers
```typescript
import { ScoreName, Toot, Weights, WeightPresetLabel } from "fedialgo";

// Get and set score weightings (the things controlled by the sliders in the demo app)
const weights: Weights = await algo.getUserWeights();
weights[ScoreName.NUM_REPLIES] = 0.5;
let timelineFeed: Toot[] = await algo.updateUserWeights(weights);

// Additional properties (description, min value, etc) can be found in 'weightsInfo'.
for (const key in algo.weightsInfo) {
    console.log(`Weight '${key}' info: ${algo.weightsInfo[key]}`);
}

// Or choose a preset weight configuration using the WeightPresetLabel enum
timelineFeed = await algo.updateUserWeightsToPreset(WeightPresetLabel.CHRONOLOGICAL);
// All the presets can be found in algo.weightPresets
Object.entries(algo.weightPresets).forEach(([presetName, weights]) => {
    console.log(`${presetName}:`, weights)
});
```

#### Filtering The Feed
```typescript
import { BooleanFilterName, ScoreName, TagTootsCacheKey, Toot, Weights } from "fedialgo";

// Set a filter for only German language toots
algo.filters.booleanFilters[BooleanFilterName.LANGUAGE].updateOption("de", true);
const filteredFeed: Toot[] = algo.updateFilters(filters);

// Set a filter for only toots with at least 3 replies
algo.filters.numericFilters[ScoreName.NUM_REPLIES].value = 3;
const filteredFeed: Toot[] = algo.updateFilters(filters);

// There's also a lot of information available about the options that can be chosen for each filter
filters.booleanFilters[BooleanFilterName.HASHTAG].options.forEach((option) => {
    console.log(`Tooted the hashtag "${option.name} ${option[TagTootsCacheKey.PARTICIPATED_TAG_TOOTS]} times`);
});
```

#### Errors
Most minor API errors will be handled silently so that if, for example, fedialgo only gets half of a user's recent toots or whatever that doesn't cause any issues for the client app. If you want to see what, if any, errors were encountered during the scoring process you can check `apiErrorMsgs` to find them.

```typescript
console.log(`API errors:`, algo.apiErrorMsgs);
```

#### Resetting Everything
You can wipe the browser storage and reset all variables if needed.
```typescript
// Delete the user's timeline and historical data but preserve the user session
await algo.reset();
// Wipe EVERYTHING (will force a logout and complete reauthentication)
await algo.reset(true);
```

# Documentation
There is [JSDoc generated documentation](https://michelcrypt4d4mus.github.io/fedialgo/) of most of `fedialgo`'s public API (classes and methods).

### Other Data Available From `TheAlgorithm`
FediAlgo exports a number of types and enums; check [the documentation](https://michelcrypt4d4mus.github.io/fedialgo/) or look at the bottom of [`index.ts`](src/index.ts) for details on what is available. `TheAlgorithm` objects provide a bunch of data besides the timeline should you choose to access it.

#### Fediverse Trending Data
Current "trending" fediverse data can be accessed at `algo.trendingData`. See [`types.ts`](src/types.ts) or [the object API documentation](https://michelcrypt4d4mus.github.io/fedialgo/) for info on the data type.

```typescript
// Trending links
algo.trendingData.links.foreach((link) => console.log(`'${link.uri}' tooted by ${link.numAccounts} accounts`));
// Trending tags
algo.trendingData.tags.foreach((tag) => console.log(`'${tag.name}' tooted by ${tag.numAccounts} accounts`));
// Trending toots
algo.trendingData.toots.foreach((toot) => console.log(`Trending toot w/rank ${toot.trendingRank}: '${toot.description}'`));
// Popular servers
console.log(`Servers used to determine trending data:`, algo.trendingData.servers);
```

#### User Data
The user's followed accounts, muted accounts, followed tags, and a few other bits and bobs used to compute the scoring of the timeline can be accessed at `algo.userData`. See [the documentation](https://michelcrypt4d4mus.github.io/fedialgo/UserData.html) or [`user_data.ts`](src/api/user_data.ts) for info on the data type (and be aware this is probably the least stable / most subject to change part of the fedialgo API).

#### Current State
There's a unified method to collect a bunch of information (`fedialgo` configuration, server configuration, user data, filter settings, etc.) with a single call. Note that the returned data structure is not currently intended for anything other than debugging and is therefore subject to change / should not be relied upon.

```typescript
const currentState = await algo.getCurrentState();
```

#### `Toot` Object API
The timeline is returned as an array of `Toot` objects which are a minimal extension of the mastodon API's `Status` object with a few more properties and some helper methods. Check [the documentation](https://michelcrypt4d4mus.github.io/fedialgo/Toot.html) or [`toot.ts`](./src/api/objects/toot.ts) for details. In particular note that you can mark a `Toot` object's `numTimesShown` property, at which point the `AlreadyShownScorer` will return non-zero values for that Toot.

```typescript
timelineFeed[0].numTimesShown = 1;
```

### Package Configuration
Package configuration options can be found in [`src/config.ts`](src/config.ts). These can't currently be changed via the API though feel free to experiment with your local copy of the repo or ping me if you have a use case for updating some of the configuration variables.
